# simpleDiceApp
this is a simple app designed to simulate a single die rolled and display the result on a canvas drawing of the result.
Array of objects which store coords for a given result. Use random function to get a die roll result. The result can then be used to filter through the array of objects for a matching result, which then gives an array of x,y coords objects to draw
